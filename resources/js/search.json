[[{"i":"what-is-geniish","l":"What is geniish?","p":["geniish is a multi-chain protocol and platform that delivers private NFTs for everyone creating exclusive content through Oasis Parcel technology. Our vision is to extend the NFT space by offering an accessible way to link NFTs with exclusive content for the collectors.","One of the biggest problems for NFTs arises when creators want to offer exclusive content to their collectors. Current solutions solve this by hosting the exclusive content centralized on servers that check the signature of the collector's wallet. geniish uses Oasis Parcel to allow a fully decentralized way to access exclusive content.","With geniish you can create NFT collections that have files, images, videos and 3D models attached to them only accessible by the NFTs holder.
