# Demo

Our short demonstration shows you how you can interact with private NFTs as a collector. This doesn't take longer than _five minutes_.

We set up multiple demo tokens with a pixelated preview image publicly viewable within the metadata. The full resolution image is saved as exclusive content on Parcel accessible via our dApp.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following setup correctly.

- Metamask with Emerald Testnet configured (https://metamask.io/)
- Oasis account (https://steward.oasislabs.com/)

## Access the exclusive content

All demo tokens have the uncensored full-resolution version of the preview image attached as exclusive content. Unlock the token's documents to see that content.
