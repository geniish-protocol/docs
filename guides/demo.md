# Demo

Our short demonstration shows you how you can interact with private NFTs as a collector. This doesn't take longer than _five minutes_.

We set up multiple demo tokens with a pixelated preview image publicly viewable within the metadata. The full resolution image is saved as exclusive content on Parcel accessible via our dApp.

## Requirements

- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
- Emerald Testnet configured ([Read more](https://docs.oasis.dev/general/developer-resources/emerald-paratime/#testnet))
- Some test ROSE tokens ([Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.oasis.dev/))
